# **HAND MOTION CONTROLLED ROBOTIC ARM**

This system allows controlling a robotic arm by hand movements. This system uses RF receiver which is interfaced to the 8051 microcontroller which controls the driver IC which is responsible to control the movement of the arm. The transmitter circuit consists of an accelerometer sensor which is interfaced to the microcontroller. The transmitter circuit sends commands to the receiver circuit. These commands indicate whether to move the robotic arm in upward or downward direction or whether the commands indicates to grip an object or release it.

## **OBJECTIVES**

To Design Hand Motion Controlled Robotic Arm that use an accelerometer sensor for controlling the hand movement to move upward, move backward, grip object, release object and have 
a suitable LCD to show the status of hand movement.
